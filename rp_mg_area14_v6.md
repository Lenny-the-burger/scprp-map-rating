#### Notes:
- Extensive sounds and several staff rooms
    - Like holy shit so many sounds i havent even heard all of them before.
    - Buttons are intuitive no need to label them.

## Optimization:

Surface may be of conern as it is not very optimized, but its also very detailed.

Overall is ok. Some thought was put into optimization, but it was either not done well or some parts of the map were forgotten.

## Visual benchmark results (higher is better):
Not entirely sure what these results mean but they probably mean how many fps we get only rendering specific things.
